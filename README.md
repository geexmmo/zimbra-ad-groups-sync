# zimbra-ad-groups-sync
Is a set of scripts that can help you to synchronize AD groups Zimbra's distribution lists.

Different scripts works different directions:
***zimbra-to-ad.py*** - will gather distribution lists including its members and will create new AD enteties based on information gathered
***ad-to-zimbra.py*** - will parse AD group information and populate Zimbra's distribution lists file accordingly.

# Requirements
### Python packages:
`pip install python-ldap`

or
	
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### System
python-ldap may require python or ldap development headers, pip installation will fail with error if this is the case.

On Debian/Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev`

RedHat/CentOS:
`sudo yum install python-devel openldap-devel`
# Scripts
## settings.py
*settings.py* should be modified according to your AD setup, other scripts are heavily dependent on correct configuration supplied in this file.

## ad-to-zimbra.py
ad-to-zimbra.py gets information out of AD and creates batch file for zmprov
Already existing data in zimbra will be left intact, only new groups or group memers are added.
User without mail field are skipped.

*There is a little hack in user DN search for members in OU's wich names contains special symbols in their DN, Users DN is cut to conents of it's CN part with hope that it really contains user's name, if first search fails - another one is lauched for user's 'name' field.*

## zimbra-to-ad.py
# Setup and troubleshooting
#### If you are using Python's virtual environment to install python-ldap
Crontab job may fail if any of required packages or python versions is not avaiable outside virtual environment.

You may use this simple bash script, just change second line to match you environment.
*syncDL.sh example*
    #!/bin/bash
    cd /opt/zimbra/zimbra-adgroup-sync/
    source bin/activate
    python ad-to-zimbra.py

#### Running batch file generated by ad-to-zimbra.py:
 Final result of running ad-to-zimbra.py is a ***ad-to-zimbra.log*** file, it containts commands that can be understood by and structured to be compalable with **zmprov** from zimbra distribution.

You may run batch import as *root* - or *su* into and run it as user *zimbra*

 Example as zimbra
 `zmprov -f commands.zmp`
 
 Piping whole file as root user
 `cat commands.zmp | su - zimbra -c zmprov`

User *zimbra* may lack neccesary permissions to create output files and logs
```bash
chown -R zimbra:zimbra /opt/zimbra/zimbra-adgroup-sync/
```

Example crontab
*This will run syncDL.sh and run batch import every 4 hours*
```bash
0 */4 * * * /opt/zimbra/zimbra-adgroup-sync/syncDL.sh && zmprov -f /opt/zimbra/zimbra-adgroup-sync/ad-to-zimbra.log
```
